## volcano-plot-for-1-dataset
# volcano plots of G1 vs G3 &amp; Aggressive vs Non-aggressive subtypes of breast tissue samples using packages in R including “ggplot2”, “reshape2”, “plotly"
# Breast cancer datasets from GEO database were collected. For DE (Differential Expression) analysis, based on the features of the collected data, two classifications were extracted including Grade1 vs Grade3 & Aggressive (LumB, Basal, HER2) vs Non-aggressive (LumA, Normal) subtypes of breast tissue samples. The objective was to determine that the resultant DEGs of which classification could differentiate better between primary (Grade 1 and or Non-aggressive subtypes) and advanced breast cancer samples (Grade3 and or Aggressive subtypes). Therefore, as the first step, this piece of code was written to construct volcano plots (with adjusted P-value of 0.01 or 0.05 / |log FC|> 1 and or 1.5).
